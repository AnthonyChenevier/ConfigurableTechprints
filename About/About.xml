  <description>Make colonies struggle that bit harder by locking their favourite research projects behind techprints, forcing them to trade, quest or raid to get access to all that sweet, sweet new technology (with the added benefit of reduced research cost!). Uses vanilla mechanics and systems (added in Royalty) as much as possible and attempts to balance generated techprint requirements, market prices, factional availabilities and research costs with vanilla values. A settings page is provided where you can change nearly all factors that impact techprint generation, including custom settings for both techprints and traders, allowing a great deal of flexibility in how you want to restrict the progression of technology within your colonies.
